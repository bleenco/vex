### Establish tunnel via running vex server on bleenco.space

Let's say you are running HTTP server locally on port 6500, then command would be:

```sh
ssh -R 10100:localhost:6500 bleenco.space -p 2200
```

where 10100 is randomly picked port to bind SSH listener on server to establish tunnels. You should pick that random and don't use 10100 if not free.

2200 is port where vex daemon (server) is running and localhost:6500 is local HTTP server.

Example output:

```sh
$ ssh -R 10500:localhost:6500 bleenco.space -p 2200
[vexd] Generated URL: http://23c41c01.bleenco.space
```

Then open generated URL in the browser to check if works, then share the URL if needed.

### Run cross-compilation build

```sh
make clean && make build
```

### Running server

```sh
./build/vex-server-linux_amd64 --help
```

```
Usage: vexd [options]

Options:

-d, Domain name that HTTP server is hosted on. It is
used for generating subdomain IDs (defaults to the
environment variable VEX_DOMAIN and falls back to local.net)

-k, Path to file of a ECDSA private key. All SSH communication
will be secured using this key (defaults to the VEX_KEY environment
variable falls back to id_rsa)

-s, SSH server listen address (defaults to VEX_SSH_SERVER and
falls back to 0.0.0.0:2200)

-http, HTTP server listen address (defaults to VEX_HTTP_SERVER and
falls back to 0.0.0.0:2000)
```

### Establishing tunnel with PuTTY and bleenco.space service

Lets say, you are running local webserver on port 7500.

Open PuTTY;

Host Name (or IP address): `bleenco.space` and Port: `2200`
