# VEX

Vex is an improved localtunnel or http tunnel written in ANSI C. This repository provides client and server implementation.

We improve localtunnel in following points:
* Server creates TCP tunnels on demand, only after receiving a request from the client. There are no *n* open sockets awaiting for incomming requests.

## Building project

```sh
make
```

Build artifacts will be stored in `build/` directory.

## Using bleenco.space server

We provide a hosted `vex` server with the `vex.bleenco.space` root domain name free of any charge for you to use it. Feel free to try it out and use it on your projects.

For example, if you are running some http service on local port 6500:

```
$ vex -i myid -r vex.bleenco.space -p 6500 
```
